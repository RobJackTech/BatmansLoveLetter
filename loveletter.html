 <p>“After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we
    saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I
    think it’s time I let you know how I feel about you.”</p> 


<h2>You are the light of my life</h2>
    You complete my darkness with your light. I love:
    </p>
    <uL>
    <li>the way you see good in the worst things</li>
     <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
    
    <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
    
    </uL>
    <p>I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over the time.</p>

    <h2>I have a confession to make</h2>
  <p>
    It feels like my chest <em>does</em> have a heart. You make my heart beat. Your smile brings smile on my face, your pain brings pain to my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't show my emotions, but I think this man behind the mask is falling for you.
  </p>
  <p><strong>I love you Batwoman.</strong></p>
  <p>
    Your not-so-secret-lover, <br>
    Batman
